The government spends billions of dollars per year on a dizzying array of gear and specialized services: office furniture, cloud computing, breakfast cereal, and advanced weapons systems are among destinations of taxpayer funds. I created a project to explore how a half-trillion dollars of federal funds go to Washington D.C. contractors and competitors in 50 states.

This analysis, based on data published on Enigma Public, explores the geography of the nearly half-trillion dollars of annual contract spending among beltway firms and the thousands of regional and small-town.

This analysis uses USA Spending data published on Enigma Public. It includes 2016 (the last year full data is available) federal government contracts greater than $1 million that were awarded to US-based companies and executed in the United States. Beltway includes cities with a geographic center in the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area.
