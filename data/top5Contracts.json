THE CYGNSS MISSION IS A CLASS D SCIENCE INVESTIGATION. THE CYGNSS MISSION GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE COUPLING BETWEEN OCEAN SURFACE PROPERTIES, MOIST ATMOSPHERIC THERMODYNAMICS, RADIATION, AND CONVECTIVE DYNAMICS IN THE INNER CORE OF TROPICAL CYCLONES (TCS). THE GOAL DIRECTLY SUPPORTS THE NASA STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE TO ENABLE IMPROVED PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY FOR WEATHER AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. NEAR-SURFACE WINDS ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO AND INDICATORS OF MOMENTUM AND ENERGY FLUXES AT THE AIR/SEA INTERFACE. UNDERSTANDING THE COUPLING BETWEEN THE SURFACE WINDS AND THE MOIST ATMOSPHERE WITHIN THE TC INNER CORE IS KEY TO PROPERLY MODELING AND FORECASTING ITS GENESIS AND INTENSIFICATION. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN STORM INTENSITY FORECASTS OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, RELATIVE TO FORECASTS OF STORM TRACK. ADVANCES IN TRACT FORECAST HAVE RESULTED IN LARGE PART FROM THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN OBSERVATIONS AND MODELING OF THE MESOSCALE AND SYNOPTIC ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING A TC. THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE LACK OF AN ACCOMPANYING IMPROVEMENT IN INTENSITY FORECAST IS LARGELY DUE TO A LACK OF OBSERVATIONS AND PROPER MODELING OF THE TC INNER CORE. THE INADEQUACY IN OBSERVATIONS RESULTS FROM TWO CAUSES. 1. MUCH OF THE INNER CORE OCEAN SURFACE IS OBSCURED FROM CONVENTIONAL REMOTE SENSING INSTRUMENTS BY INTENSE PRECIPITATION IN THE EYE WALL AND INNER RAIN BANDS. 2. THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING GENESIS AND INTENSIFICATION STAGES OF THE TC LIFE CYCLE ARE POORLY SAMPLED BY CONVENTIONAL POLAR-ORBITING, WIDE-SWAT IMAGERS. CYGNSS ADDRESSES THESE TWO LIMITATIONS BY COMBINING THE ALL-WEATHER PERFORMANCE OF GPS-BASED BISTATIC SCATTEROMETRY WITH THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SAMPLING PROPERTIES OF A CONSTELLATION OF OBSERVATORIES. THE CONSTELLATION CONSISTS OF INDIVIDUAL GPS SURFACE REFLECTION RECEIVERS FLOWN ON 8 NANOSATELLITES. THIS PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO MEASURE THE OCEAN SURFACE WINDS WITH UNPRECEDENTED TEMPORAL RESOLUTION AND SPATIAL COVERAGE UNDER ALL PRECIPITATING CONDITIONS, UP TO AND INCLUDING THOSE EXPERIENCED IN THE HURRICANE EYEWALL. CYGNSS ACHIEVES ITS GOAL USING INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, LABORATORY TESTED AND VERIFIED IN A RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT, TO AVOID THE RISKS INHERENT WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES.","vLocation":"ANN ARBOR, MI"},{"place_of_performance_congressional_district":"MI12","mod_agency":"7530: CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES","vendor_name":"REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN","dollars_obligated":5106440,"description_of_contract_requirement":"IGF::CT::IGF THE PURPOSE OF THIS ACTION IS TO EXERCISE OPTION YEAR 3","vLocation":"ANN ARBOR, MI"},{"place_of_performance_congressional_district":"TN05","mod_agency":"7530: CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES","vendor_name":"ADVANCEMED CORPORATION","dollars_obligated":18381808,"description_of_contract_requirement":"ZONE PROGRAM INTEGRITY CONTRACTOR - ZPIC ZONE 5","vLocation":"ROCKVILLE, MD"},{"place_of_performance_congressional_district":"TN05","mod_agency":"7530: CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES","vendor_name":"CGS ADMINISTRATORS, LLC","dollars_obligated":15096618,"description_of_contract_requirement":"IGF::CL::IGF J15 A/B MAC","vLocation":"NASHVILLE, TN"},{"place_of_performance_congressional_district":"TN05","mod_agency":"7014: U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION","vendor_name":"VF IMAGEWEAR, INC.","dollars_obligated":39740208,"description_of_contract_requirement":"NON-MILITARY UNIFORMS USED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY.

THE 2013 REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE ON STEM EDUCATION FOUND THAT OUR CURRENT EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS ARE NOT LEADING TO A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE AND WELL-TRAINED STEM WORKFORCE. NOR IS OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM CREATING A STEM-LITERATE PUBLIC. NASA AND GLOBE RESOURCES HAVE PLAYED A TRANSFORMATIVE ROLE IN SOME SCHOOLS AND WITH SOME STUDENTS BUT MORE INTENTIONAL, STRATEGIC AND SYSTEMIC APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THESE ASSETS PROMOTE REAL LEARNING AT ALL GRADE LEVELS, PUBLIC STEM LITERACY, AND A WELLTRAINED STEM WORKFORCE. MISSION EARTH PROJECT APPROACH THE MISSION EARTH TEAM CONSISTS OF GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED PARTNERS PREPARED TO WORK WITH URBAN AND RURAL HIGH NEED SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE NORTHEAST, MID-WEST, SOUTHWEST, AND NORTHWEST, TO PRODUCE NATIONAL SYSTEMIC CHANGE IN STEM EDUCATION. MISSION EARTH BRINGS TOGETHER SCIENTISTS AND SCIENCE EDUCATORS TO DEVELOP A K-12 EARTH AS A SYSTEM CURRICULUM PROGRESSION FOLLOWING RESEARCH-BASED BEST PRACTICES. THE CURRICULUM WILL INCORPORATE DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO MAKE IT APPROPRIATE FOR ALL STUDENT POPULATIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE CURRENTLY UNDER EPRESENTED IN STEM CAREERS. OUR CORE MEMBERS, UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO (MIDDLE SCHOOL PROJECT BASED SCIENCE), WESTED (HIGH SCHOOL CAREER READINESS), BOSTON UNIVERSITY (ELEMENTARY AND COLLEGE ENGINEERING PRACTICES), TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY (COLLEGE SERVICE LEARNING) WILL SHARE THEIR RESULTS AS THE TEAM BUILDS A K-12 PROGRESSION OF ACTIVITIES. TO ARRIVE AT THESE GOALS, MISSION EARTH WILL ENGAGE IN THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES: 1.DEVELOP CURRICULAR MATERIALS TO SUPPORT A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED K-12 LEARNING PROGRESSION THAT FUSES NASA LEARNING ASSETS WITH GLOBE ACTIVITIES TO TEACH EARTH AS A SYSTEM. 2.DEVELOP MODELS OF EDUCATIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (EPD) THAT RESULT IN TEACHERS USE OF NASA AND GLOBE LEARNING AND TEACHING ASSETS, ESPECIALLY IN HIGH NEED DISTRICTS. 3.DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURES IN SCHOOLS FOR USE OF NASA/GLOBE LEARNING AND TEACHING ASSETS. 4.SUPPORT STEM CAREER DEVELOPMENT THROUGH LINKAGES TO SCIENCES, REAL WORLD APPLICATION, AND INTERSEGMENTAL SERVICE LEARNING 5.COLLABORATE AND BUILD CAPACITY WITH DISTRICT AND STATE AGENCIES, INCLUDING TRAIN-THE-TRAINER APPROACHES. 6.INFUSE TEACHER PREPARATION WITH NASA/GLOBE LEARNING AND TEACHING ASSETS. EACH YEAR, WE WILL HOST A MEETING FOR GLOBE AND NASA COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES, AND FOR UPDATES FROM NASA LARC AND JPL ON AIRBORNE AND SATELLITE MISSIONS, MY NASA DATA, AND THE SCOOL PROGRAMS. DISSEMINATION WILL OCCUR AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL BY TEACHERS TURNED GLOBE TRAINERS, AND NATIONALLY THROUGH THE GLOBE US PARTNERSHIPS FACILITATED BY THE U.S. COUNTRY COORDINATOR, AS WELL AS THROUGH EXISTING NETWORKS.

THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO 1) INTEGRATE AND SYNTHESIZE INFORMATION FROM ONGOING MONITORING PROGRAMS COORDINATED BY THE INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (IOOS); 2) DEFINE THE MINIMUM SET OF OBSERVATIONS REQUIRED FOR IMPLEMENTING A PRACTICAL, USEFUL MBON; 3) DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY FOR BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENTS THROUGH EMERGING ENVIRONMENTAL DNA (EDNA) MOLECULAR METHODS AND AUTONOMOUS SAMPLE COLLECTION; 4) INTEGRATE BIODIVERSITY MEASUREMENTS IN A RELATIONAL DATABASE THAT LINKS TO NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL BIODIVERSITY DATABASES AND THAT INFORMS NOAA'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM; 5) ESTABLISH A PROTOCOL FOR MBON INFORMATION TO DYNAMICALLY UPDATE SANCTUARY STATUS AND TRENDS REPORTS; AND 6) UNDERSTAND THE LINKAGES BETWEEN MARINE BIODIVERSITY AND THE SOCIAL-ECONOMIC CONTEXT OF A REGION. THE PROGRAM WILL USE THE NOVEL EDNA TECHNIQUES AND ONGOING OBSERVATIONS TO EVALUATE HABITAT DIVERSITY AND DIVERSITY OF LOWER TO HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS, TO DEFINE THE ECOLOGICAL STATE VARIABLES RESPONSIBLE FOR SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN BIODIVERSITY INDICES AND HELP IDENTIFY INVASIVE SPECIES. MULTIDISCIPLINARY REMOTE SENSING WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE DYNAMIC 'SEASCAPES' TO EXTEND THE SPATIAL FOOTPRINT OF THE IN SITU DATA. THESE TIME SERIES OF BIODIVERSITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBSERVATIONS WILL HELP CONSTRUCT CONCEPTUAL AND FORECAST MODELS OF THE INTER-RELATIONS BETWEEN HUMAN DIMENSIONS, CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY, AND ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE AT MULTIPLE TROPHIC LEVELS. A PLAN TO TRANSITION THE MBON TO OPERATIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NOAA AND THE IOOS PROGRAM.
